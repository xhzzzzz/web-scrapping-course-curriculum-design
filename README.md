# web-scrapping-course-curriculum-design
The purpose of this project is to design a course curriculum  for a new  “Master of Business and Management in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence” program at University of Toronto with focus not 
only on technical but also on business and soft skills. Experiment with different Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to extract skills (features) from 
the web-scarped job postings. Those skills are extracted from job postings as features and run two clustering algorithms to create clusters of skills that can be interpreted as courses. First clustering algorithm that I used is hierarchical clustering algorithm with one feature, where that feature represents a distance between each pair of skills. For the second clustering algorithm I choose  between  k-means  and 
DBSCAN.
